\begin{abstract}
We introduce OpSets, an executable framework for specifying and reasoning about the semantics of replicated datatypes that provide eventual consistency in a distributed system, and for mechanically verifying algorithms that implement these datatypes.
Our approach is simple but expressive, allowing us to succinctly specify a variety of abstract datatypes, including maps, sets, lists, text, graphs, trees, and registers.
Our datatypes are also composable, enabling the construction of complex data structures.
To demonstrate the utility of OpSets for analysing replication algorithms, we highlight an important correctness property for collaborative text editing that has traditionally been overlooked; algorithms that do not satisfy this property can exhibit awkward interleaving of text.
We use OpSets to specify this correctness property and prove that although one existing replication algorithm satisfies this property, several other published algorithms do not.
We also show how OpSets can be used to develop new replicated datatypes: we provide a simple specification of an atomic move operation for trees, an operation that had previously been thought to be impossible to implement without locking.
We use the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant throughout to formalise the OpSets approach and produce mechanised proofs of correctness of the main claims in this paper, thereby eliminating the ambiguity of previous informal approaches, and ruling out reasoning errors that could occur in handwritten proofs.

\section{Introduction}

A common requirement across many distributed systems is that several nodes may concurrently access and manipulate some shared data structure.
Examples include everything from journalists using their laptops to work on a shared text document to a set of front-end web-servers manipulating a common database.
In doing so, it is important that the shared data satisfies certain \emph{consistency guarantees}.
For example, strong consistency models such as serializability \cite{Kleppmann:2017wj} or linearizability \cite{Herlihy:1990jq} make a system behave like a single sequentially executing node, even when it is in fact replicated and concurrent.
An unavoidable downside of these models is that any operation or transaction must wait for network communication before it is allowed to complete \cite{Davidson:1985hv,Gilbert:2002il}.
Thus, in a system with strong consistency, a node cannot make progress while it is offline or partitioned from other nodes.

On the other hand, \emph{eventual consistency} \cite{Bailis:2013jc,Burckhardt:2014hy,Terry:1994fp,Vogels:2009ca} allows each participant to modify a local copy (\emph{replica}) of a shared data structure while offline, but its definition is very weak: \emph{``if no new updates are made to the shared state, all nodes will eventually have the same data.''}
The premise \emph{if no new updates are made} may never be true if the shared state is continually modified because the system is never quiescent.
Moreover, the final system state is unconstrained: nothing in the definition of eventual consistency specifies which states are legal.

Conflict-free Replicated Data Types, or CRDTs \cite{Shapiro:2011wy,Shapiro:2011un}, are abstractions for replicated state that have received significant attention in recent years (see \S~\ref{sec:relwork}).
The primary correctness property for CRDTs is \emph{convergence} \cite{Shapiro:2011un,Gomes:2017gy}, defined as: \emph{``whenever any two replicas have applied the same set of updates, they are in the same state''}, even if each replica applies the updates in a different order.
Convergence is a stronger property than eventual consistency, but it also fails to define what the converged state should be.

In this work we introduce \emph{Operation Sets} (or \emph{OpSets} for short), a novel approach for specifying the semantics of replicated datatypes, and for reasoning about algorithms for concurrent data access and manipulation.
We go beyond merely ensuring replica convergence: the OpSets approach is a form of executable specification that precisely defines the permitted states of a replica after some set of updates has been applied.
Our contributions in this paper are as follows:

\begin{itemize*}
\item In \S~\ref{sec:approach} we introduce the OpSet, a new abstraction for specifying and reasoning about the consistency properties of concurrently editable data structures.

\item On top of this abstraction, in \S~\ref{sec:datatypes} and \S~\ref{sec:tree}, we specify a variety of composable abstract datatypes (maps, sets, lists, text, graphs, trees, and registers), and we argue that our specifications are both simple and precise, making them a suitable tool for reasoning about replicated data.

\item In \S~\ref{sec:bad-merge} we demonstrate how the OpSet abstraction can be used to reason about existing algorithms. We highlight an important correctness property for collaborative text editing that has been overlooked by prior work in this area.
Our specification is, to our knowledge, the first that correctly captures this property.
We then review a selection of text editing CRDTs from the literature, prove that one satisfies our specification, and identify several others that fail to satisfy our correctness property.

\item In \S~\ref{sec:tree} we show how the OpSet abstraction can be used to develop new replicated datatypes. In particular we describe, for the first time, how an atomic move operation can be defined for a tree CRDT.
This operation can be used to move a subtree to a new position within the tree, or to rename a key in a map, or to reorder items in a list.
The OpSets approach enables a simple definition of this operation that had previously been thought impossible without locking \cite{Najafzadeh:2017vk}.

\item Using the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant~\cite{DBLP:conf/tphol/WenzelPN08} we formalise the OpSets approach, producing mechanised proofs of correctness of the main claims in this paper.
In particular, we prove that our list specification is strictly stronger than the recent specification of collaborative text editing by Attiya et al. \cite{Attiya:2016kh}.
By using mechanised proofs we eliminate the ambiguity of previous informal approaches, and rule out reasoning errors that could occur in handwritten proofs.
Moreover, the proof framework we have developed is reusable and can be leveraged to verify other datatypes in the future.

\section{Conclusion}

In this work we have introduced Operation Sets (OpSets), a simple but expressive approach for specifying the semantics of replicated datatypes.
We specified a variety of common, composable replicated datatypes in the OpSets model, and used Isabelle/HOL to formally reason about their properties.
We have also shown how the OpSet abstraction can be used to reason about existing replication algorithms, and developed a new specification to highlight an interleaving anomaly that affects some existing collaborative text editing algorithms.
Finally we demonstrated how the OpSet model to can be used to develop new specifications to support algorithm design, and developed a specification for an atomic move operation in a tree CRDT.

The OpSets approach is a form of executable specification that precisely defines the permitted states of a replica after some set of updates have been applied.
The simplicity of our approach builds on sequential OpSet interpretation: operations are applied in strict ascending order of ID.
This property is very useful as it trivially ensures convergence, and it simplifies reasoning about specifications and invariants for CRDTs.
In contrast, the traditional approach requires operations to be defined in a way that is commutative, increasing their complexity.
We took advantage of the ease of specification to demonstrate the correspondence between sequential specification and commutative implementation, proving that the RGA CRDT satisfies our OpSet specification of lists.
For future work it will be interesting to further explore this correspondence for other datatypes; in particular, we hypothesise that it is possible to derive a tree CRDT with a commutative move operation from the specification in \S~\ref{sec:tree}.

%More generally, one can regard the OpSet as a \emph{database of facts}, containing all changes ever made to the shared data, and the interpretation function a \emph{query} over this database, with the resulting datatype being a \emph{materialized view} in database terminology.
%When new operations are added to an OpSet $O$, computing the corresponding change to $\llbracket O \rrbracket$ is a \emph{materialized view maintenance} problem, which has been studied extensively in the database literature \cite{Gupta:1999uz}.
%We have found that thinking about replicated datatypes as materialized views onto an OpSet a useful perspective for understanding and improving replication algorithms, and in future work we aim to explore this idea more fully.
