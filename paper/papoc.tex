\section{Introduction}

In collaborative software, several users may contribute to a project by creating and editing shared documents, such as text documents, spreadsheets, graphics files, or presentations.
When a user wishes to view a document, a copy of that document is loaded on the user's computer (e.g.\ in a tab of their web browser, or in a native app on their device).
When a user wishes to modify a document, their changes are immediately applied to the copy of the document on the user's computer, and then asynchronously sent to any other users who have a copy of the document (possibly via a server, which may also store a copy).
This collaboration scenario is very similar to the problem of replication in distributed databases: in this context, the shared data is a database rather than a document, and each node that has a copy of the data is called a \emph{replica}.

At a high level, there are two possible ways of managing modifications to documents: either the system enforces that only one user at a time may edit a particular document (for example by obtaining a lock on the file before allowing any modifications), or the system allows multiple users to edit a document concurrently.
The latter case is known as \emph{optimistic replication}.
In an optimistic replication setting, it can happen that several users make changes at the same time, leading the state of these users' documents to diverge.
This is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:hello-world}, where one user changes the document \texttt{`Hello!'} to \texttt{`Hello World!'}, while another user concurrently changes it to \texttt{`Hello! :)'}.
In order to ensure that no user input is lost, these concurrent changes must be merged into a consistent document~-- in this example, \texttt{`Hello World! :)'}.

This kind of merge can either be performed manually (the approach employed by most version control systems, such as git), or it can be automated.
Conflict-free Replicated Data Types, or CRDTs~\cite{Shapiro:2011wy,Shapiro:2011un}, have been developed to automate such merges.
A CRDT is an abstract datatype whose state can be modified by performing certain operations (for example, a datatype for text editing may allow characters to be inserted or deleted anywhere in the document).
It allows arbitrary operations to be performed on different replicas; either the updated state or the operations or the operations are then sent over the network and applied or merged into copies of the document on other replicas.

\subsection{Consistency for Optimistic Replication}

CRDTs provide a consistency model called \emph{strong eventual consistency}~\cite{Shapiro:2011un,Gomes:2017gy}, which is defined by the following properties:
\begin{description}
\item[Eventual delivery]: An update applied on one correct replica is eventually applied on all correct replicas.
\item[Convergence]: If the same set of updates have been applied on two replicas, those replicas have equivalent state.
\item[Termination]: All method executions terminate.
\end{description}
In operation-based CRDTs the convergence property is implemented by ensuring that concurrent operations commute.
For example, in Figure~\ref{fig:hello-world}, User 1 first applies the insertion of \texttt{` World'} and then the insertion of \texttt{` :)'}, while User 2 applies the insertions in the opposite order.
Commutativity of the insertion ensures that the outcome is the same in both cases.

When replicas mutually merge each others' changes, the convergence property ensures that those replicas end up in the same state.
However, nothing so far has specified what that state should be.
This means that, although strong eventual consistency is necessary, it is not sufficient, as it does not capture all of the consistency properties that we require in a collaborative application.

In this paper we examine a particular consistency property for collaborative text editors that has so far been overlooked in the literature.
A failure to satisfy this property may result in arbitrary text interleaving, potentially resulting in an undesirable document state.
We highlight existing CRDT algorithms and a specification that exhibit this anomaly, and compare them to other approaches that do not suffer from this anomaly, or only a lesser variant.
